                <div class="boxcenter" style="font-size: 20px">
                    <p>At REAL, our mission is to provide a reliable and user-friendly period tracker 
                        prioritizes privacy and accessibility. We aim to help users manage their menstrual cycles 
                        for medical reasons, family planning, and personal organization without compromising their 
                        personal data. Our web-based application, built with C#, React, and SQL, offers features like 
                        cycle forecasts, phase tracking, a calendar for past and future cycles, and a symptoms log. We 
                        ensure data protection by avoiding the use of personal information for login, keeping user data 
                        secure and confidential. At REAL, we are dedicated to supporting our community with a trustworthy 
                        and secure period tracking tool.</p>

                <div class="boxcenter" style="font-size: 20px">
                    <p>This web based application will include a forecast feature that provides users with
                         predictions of their upcoming menstrual cycles, including start and end dates, ovulation 
                         day, and the fertile window. This feature includes a phase tracking component that monitors
                          which phase -- menstrual, follicular, ovulation, or luteal -- the user is currently in. A 
                          calendar feature will allow users view cycle data from previous cycles and expected cycle 
                          data for months to come. The website will additionally feature a symptoms log where users 
                          can track daily symptoms such as cramps, bloating, headaches, as well as energy and mood levels.</p>
